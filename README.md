# Research-Assistant-Agent-version
Here I will be developing a Research Agent from the scratch. Here is the planning and structure of the first version:

1. Use an LLM (like GPT-3.5/4) to generate a research plan given a topic.
2. Use the LLM to generate search queries based on the research plan.
3. Use a search API (like Google Search) to get relevant links.
4. Use web scraping to extract text from the top links.
5. Use an LLM to summarize the extracted text and compile a research report.
